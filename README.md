# 👋 Hi, I'm Amruth Swamy  
### Cloud & DevOps Engineer | AWS | Kubernetes | Terraform | SRE-Oriented Engineer

## 🚀 Engineering Profile

I am a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with hands-on production-focused experience in building scalable, automated, and reliable cloud infrastructure on AWS.

I design infrastructure with reliability, observability, and automation at the core — following modern DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles.

🔹 Reduced deployment time by 65% via CI/CD automation  
🔹 Implemented Blue-Green, Rolling & Canary deployments  
🔹 Built Terraform infrastructure with S3 remote backend + DynamoDB state locking  
🔹 Designed secure 3-tier AWS architecture with VPC isolation  
🔹 Deployed containerized workloads to Kubernetes clusters  
🔹 Implemented observability using Prometheus, Grafana & CloudWatch  
🔹 Configured SSL & reverse proxy using Nginx

---

## 🔁 CI/CD & Automation

- Jenkins (Pipeline as Code)
- GitHub Actions
- Automated Build → Test → Deploy pipelines
- Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- Git branching & version control best practices

---

## 📊 Monitoring, Logging & Observability

- Prometheus (Metrics collection)
- Grafana (Dashboards & Visualization)
- AWS CloudWatch (Logs, Metrics, Alarms)
- Log analysis & troubleshooting
- Basic alert threshold configuration

---

## 🔐 Web & Reverse Proxy

- Nginx configuration
