#  Profile

I am a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with hands-on production-focused experience in building scalable, automated, and reliable cloud infrastructure on AWS.

I design infrastructure with reliability, observability, and automation at the core — following modern DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles.

🔹 Reduced deployment time by 65% via CI/CD automation  
🔹 Implemented Blue-Green, Rolling & Canary deployments  
🔹 Built Terraform infrastructure with S3 remote backend + DynamoDB state locking  
🔹 Designed secure 3-tier AWS architecture with VPC isolation  
🔹 Deployed containerized workloads to Kubernetes clusters  
🔹 Implemented observability using Prometheus, Grafana & CloudWatch  
🔹 Configured SSL & reverse proxy using Nginx

#SRE Mindset

- Infrastructure as Code (No manual provisioning)
- Proactive monitoring over reactive fixing
- Automation-first approach
- Failure-aware system design
- Continuous reliability improvement

---

## Cloud & Infrastructure (AWS)

- EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, ALB, Route53, ECR
- Auto Scaling & Load Balancing
- Secure Public/Private subnet architecture
- NAT Gateway & Security Group design
- Cost optimization basics (instance right-sizing, monitoring idle resources)

---

## Infrastructure as Code

- Terraform (Modular architecture)
- Remote Backend using S3
- State Locking with DynamoDB
- Reusable Infrastructure modules
- Environment-based deployments

---

## Containers & Orchestration

- Docker (Optimized builds, container networking)
- Kubernetes (Deployments, Services, Rolling Updates)
- Blue-Green & Canary deployment strategies
- Resource management & scaling basics

---

##  CI/CD & Automation

- Jenkins (Pipeline as Code)
- GitHub Actions
- Automated Build → Test → Deploy pipelines
- Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- Git branching & version control best practices

---

##  Monitoring, Logging & Observability

- Prometheus (Metrics collection)
- Grafana (Dashboards & Visualization)
- AWS CloudWatch (Logs, Metrics, Alarms)
- Log analysis & troubleshooting
- Basic alert threshold configuration

---

##  Web & Reverse Proxy

- Nginx configuration
- SSL setup & HTTPS enforcement
- Reverse proxy routing
- Basic Apache server configuration

---

##  Production Exposure

- Handled deployment failures & debugging
- Troubleshot Linux server issues
- Monitored CPU, memory, disk bottlenecks
- Performed application log debugging
- Assisted in improving deployment reliability

---
